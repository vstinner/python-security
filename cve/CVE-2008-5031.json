Updated Service Console package python\n\n  Service Console package Python update to version 2.4.3-24.el5.\n\n  When the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization   flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that   led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values   meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than   expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the   Python interpreter's privileges.\n\n  Multiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python   Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string   object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause   a denial of service.\n\n  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop   module. If a Python application used the imageop module to   process untrusted images, it could cause the application to   disclose sensitive information, crash or, potentially, execute   arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.\n\n  Multiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the   Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use   these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption).\n\n  Multiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python   modules. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of   service.\n\n  An integer signedness error, leading to a buffer overflow, was   found in the Python zlib extension module. If a Python application   requested the negative byte count be flushed for a decompression   stream, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially,   execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges.\n\n  A flaw was discovered in the strxfrm() function of the Python   locale module. Strings generated by this function were not properly   NULL-terminated, which could possibly cause disclosure of data   stored in the memory of a Python application using this function.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2007-2052 CVE-2007-4965 CVE-2008-1721   CVE-2008-1887 CVE-2008-2315 CVE-2008-3142 CVE-2008-3143   CVE-2008-3144 CVE-2008-4864 CVE-2008-5031 to these issues.\n\n g. Updated Service Console package bind\n\n  Service Console package bind updated to version 9.3.6-4.P1.el5\n\n  The Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) is an implementation of the   Domain Name System (DNS) protocols. BIND includes a DNS server   (named); a resolver library (routines for applications to use when   interfacing with DNS); and tools for verifying that the DNS server   is operating correctly.\n\n  A flaw was found in the way BIND handles dynamic update message   packets containing the 'ANY' record type. A remote attacker could   use this flaw to send a specially crafted dynamic update packet   that could cause named to exit with an assertion failure.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-0696 to this issue.\n\n h. Updated Service Console package libxml2\n\n  Service Console package libxml2 updated to version 2.6.26-2.1.2.8.\n\n  libxml is a library for parsing and manipulating XML files. A   Document Type Definition (DTD) defines the legal syntax (and also   which elements can be used) for certain types of files, such as XML   files.\n\n  A stack overflow flaw was found in the way libxml processes the   root XML document element definition in a DTD. A remote attacker   could provide a specially crafted XML file, which once opened by a   local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.\n\n  Multiple use-after-free flaws were found in the way libxml parses   the Notation and Enumeration attribute types. A remote attacker   could provide a specially crafted XML file, which once opened by a   local, unsuspecting user, would lead to denial of service.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the names CVE-2009-2414 and CVE-2009-2416 to these   issues.\n\n i. Updated Service Console package curl\n\n  Service Console package curl updated to version 7.15.5-2.1.el5_3.5\n\n  A cURL is affected by the previously published 'null prefix attack',   caused by incorrect handling of NULL characters in X.509   certificates. If an attacker is able to get a carefully-crafted   certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, the attacker   could use the certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and   potentially confuse cURL into accepting it by mistake.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-2417 to this issue\n\n j. Updated Service Console package gnutls\n\n  Service Console package gnutil updated to version 1.4.1-3.el5_3.5\n\n  A flaw was discovered in the way GnuTLS handles NULL characters in   certain fields of X.509 certificates. If an attacker is able to get   a carefully-crafted certificate signed by a Certificate Authority   trusted by an application using GnuTLS, the attacker could use the   certificate during a man-in-the-middle attack and potentially   confuse the application into accepting it by mistake.\n\n  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org)   has assigned the name CVE-2009-2730 to this issue",

            "description": "From Red Hat Security Advisory 2009:1178 :\n\nUpdated python packages that fix multiple security issues are now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3.\n\nThis update has been rated as having moderate security impact by the Red Hat Security Response Team.\n\nPython is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language.\n\nWhen the assert() system call was disabled, an input sanitization flaw was revealed in the Python string object implementation that led to a buffer overflow. The missing check for negative size values meant the Python memory allocator could allocate less memory than expected. This could result in arbitrary code execution with the Python interpreter's privileges. (CVE-2008-1887)\n\nMultiple buffer and integer overflow flaws were found in the Python Unicode string processing and in the Python Unicode and string object implementations. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of service (Python application crash). (CVE-2008-3142, CVE-2008-5031)\n\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in the Python imageop module. If a Python application used the imageop module to process untrusted images, it could cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary code with the Python interpreter's privileges. (CVE-2008-1679, CVE-2008-4864)\n\nMultiple integer underflow and overflow flaws were found in the Python snprintf() wrapper implementation. An attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of service (memory corruption). (CVE-2008-3144)\n\nMultiple integer overflow flaws were found in various Python modules.\nAn attacker could use these flaws to cause a denial of service (Python application crash). (CVE-2008-2315, CVE-2008-3143)\n\nRed Hat would like to thank David Remahl of the Apple Product Security team for responsibly reporting the CVE-2008-1679 and CVE-2008-2315 issues.\n\nAll Python users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain backported patches to correct these issues.",
