This update adds support for the full range of user and group IDs on 64-bit architectures.

            "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities was discovered and corrected in python :\n\nBuffer underflow in the rgbimg module in Python 2.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a large ZSIZE value in a black-and-white (aka B/W) RGB image that triggers an invalid pointer dereference (CVE-2009-4134).\n\nInteger overflow in rgbimgmodule.c in the rgbimg module in Python 2.5 allows remote attackers to have an unspecified impact via a large image that triggers a buffer overflow. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-3143.12 (CVE-2010-1449).\n\nMultiple buffer overflows in the RLE decoder in the rgbimg module in Python 2.5 allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact via an image file containing crafted data that triggers improper processing within the (1) longimagedata or (2) expandrow function (CVE-2010-1450).\n\nThe asyncore module in Python before 3.2 does not properly handle unsuccessful calls to the accept function, and does not have accompanying documentation describing how daemon applications should handle unsuccessful calls to the accept function, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct denial of service attacks that terminate these applications via network connections (CVE-2010-3492).\n\nMultiple race conditions in smtpd.py in the smtpd module in Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.2 alpha allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon outage) by establishing and then immediately closing a TCP connection, leading to the accept function having an unexpected return value of None, an unexpected value of None for the address, or an ECONNABORTED, EAGAIN, or EWOULDBLOCK error, or the getpeername function having an ENOTCONN error, a related issue to CVE-2010-3492 (CVE-2010-3493).\n\nPackages for 2009.0 are provided as of the Extended Maintenance Program. Please visit this link to learn more:\nhttp://store.mandriva.com/product_info.php?cPath=149&amp;products_id=4 90\n\nThe updated packages have been patched to correct these issues.",

This update backports a     fix from Python 2.6, which resolves this issue.\n    (BZ#644147)\n\n  - Prior to version 2.5, Python's optimized memory     allocator never released memory back to the system. The     memory usage of a long-running Python process would     resemble a 'high-water mark'. This update backports a     fix from Python 2.5a1, which frees unused arenas, and     adds a non-standard sys._debugmallocstats() function,     which prints diagnostic information to stderr. Finally,     when running under Valgrind, the optimized allocator is     deactivated, to allow more convenient debugging of     Python memory usage issues.
