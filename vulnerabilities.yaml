  description: |
    A vulnerability in smtplib allowing MITM attacker to perform a startTLS
    stripping attack. smtplib does not seem to raise an exception when the
    remote end (SMTP server) is capable of negotiating starttls but fails to
    respond with 220 (ok) to an explicit call of SMTP.starttls(). This may
    allow a malicious MITM to perform a startTLS stripping attack if the client
    code does not explicitly check the response code for startTLS.

    It was discovered that the Python ``CGIHandler`` class did not properly
    protect against the ``HTTP_PROXY`` variable name clash in a CGI context.

    A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests
    performed by a Python CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a
    malicious HTTP request.

    Ignore the ``HTTP_PROXY`` variable when ``REQUEST_METHOD`` environment is
    set, which indicates that the script is in CGI mode.

    The ``is_cgi()`` method in ``CGIHTTPServer.py`` in the ``CGIHTTPServer``
    module in Python 2.5, 2.6, and 3.0 allows remote attackers to read script
    source code via an HTTP GET request that lacks a ``/`` (slash) character at
    the beginning of the URI.

  description: |
    Multiple race conditions in ``smtpd.py`` in the ``smtpd`` module in Python 2.6,
    2.7, 3.1, and 3.2 alpha allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (daemon outage) by establishing and then immediately closing a TCP
    connection, leading to the accept function having an unexpected return
    value of None, an unexpected value of None for the address, or an
    ECONNABORTED, EAGAIN, or EWOULDBLOCK error, or the getpeername function
    having an ENOTCONN error, a related issue to CVE-2010-3492.

  description: |
    The ``asyncore`` module in Python before 3.2 does not properly handle
    unsuccessful calls to the accept function, and does not have accompanying
    documentation describing how daemon applications should handle unsuccessful
    calls to the accept function, which makes it easier for remote attackers to
    conduct denial of service attacks that terminate these applications via
    network connections.

  description: |
    The ``audioop`` module in Python 2.7 and 3.2 does not verify the relationships
    between size arguments and byte string lengths, which allows
    context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption
    and application crash) via crafted arguments, as demonstrated by a call to
    ``audioop.reverse()`` with a one-byte string, a different vulnerability
    than CVE-2010-1634.

  description: |
    Multiple integer overflows in ``audioop.c`` in the ``audioop`` module in Python
    2.6, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.2 allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial
    of service (application crash) via a large fragment, as demonstrated by a
    call to audioop.lin2lin with a long string in the first argument, leading
    to a buffer overflow.

    NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for
    CVE-2008-3143.

    Multiple integer overflows in the ``imageop`` module in Python 2.5.1 and
    earlier allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service
    (application crash) and possibly obtain sensitive information (memory
    contents) via crafted arguments to (1) the ``tovideo()`` method, and
    unspecified other vectors related to (2) ``imageop.c``, (3)
    ``rbgimgmodule.c``, and other files, which trigger heap-based buffer
    overflows.

    Multiple integer overflows in Python 2.2.3 through 2.5.1, and 2.6, allow
    context-dependent attackers to have an unknown impact via a large integer
    value in the tabsize argument to the expandtabs method, as implemented by:

    * the ``string_expandtabs()`` function in ``Objects/stringobject.c``
