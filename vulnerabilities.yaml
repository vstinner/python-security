  description: |
    A vulnerability in smtplib allowing MITM attacker to perform a startTLS
    stripping attack. smtplib does not seem to raise an exception when the
    remote end (SMTP server) is capable of negotiating starttls but fails to
    respond with 220 (ok) to an explicit call of SMTP.starttls(). This may
    allow a malicious MITM to perform a startTLS stripping attack if the client
    code does not explicitly check the response code for startTLS.

    The HTTP clients in the (1) httplib, (2) urllib, (3) urllib2, and (4)
    xmlrpclib libraries in CPython (aka Python) 2.x before 2.7.9 and 3.x before
    3.4.3, when accessing an HTTPS URL, do not (a) check the certificate
    against a trust store or verify that the server hostname matches a domain
    name in the subject's (b) Common Name or (c) subjectAltName field of the
    X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL
    servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

    Check & prevent integer overflow in PyString_DecodeEscape.

    You need to compile a 1 GiB Python file on 32-bit system for reproducing
    it. It is very unlikely that this can happen by accident, and it is hard to
    used it in security attack. If you can make the attacked program compiling
    a 1 GiB Python file, you perhaps have easier ways to make a harm.

  description: |
    On February 27th, 2018, the Python Security Response team was notified
    of a buffer overflow issue in the ``os.symlink()`` method on Windows. The
    issue affects all versions of Python between 3.2 and 3.6.4, including
    the 3.7 beta releases. It has been patched for the next releases of 3.4,
    3.5, 3.6 and 3.7.

    Scripts may be vulnerable if they use ``os.symlink()`` on Windows and an
    attacker is able to influence the location where links are created. As
    os.symlink requires additional privileges, exploits using this
    vulnerability are more likely to result in escalation of privilege.

    Besides applying the fix to CPython, scripts can also ensure that the
    length of each path argument is less than 260, and if the source is a
    relative path, that its combination with the destination is also shorter
    than 260 characters. That is::

        assert (len(src) < 260 and
                len(dest) < 260 and
                len(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(dest), src)) < 260)
        os.symlink(src, dest)

    Scripts that explicitly pass the target_is_directory argument as True
    are not vulnerable. Scripts on Python 3.5 that use bytes for paths are
    not vulnerable, because of a combination of stack layout and added
    parameter validation, but will still not behave correctly for long paths.

    This vulnerability has been registered as CVE-2018-1000117, and patched
    in the commits listed below. This patch prevents the buffer overflow,
    but does not raise any new errors or enable the use of long paths when
    creating symlinks.

    Many thanks to **Alexey Izbyshev** for the report, and helping us work
    through developing the patch.

    The PSRT decided that it's a regular bug and doesn't need to be categorized
    as a vulnerability, since the attacker has to be able to run arbitrary code
    in practice.

    The PSRT considers that no Python 2.7 application currently rely on reading
    from the same file object "at the same time" from different thread, since
    it currently crashs.

    An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the X509 certificate
    parser of Python.org Python 2.7.11 / 3.6.6. A specially crafted X509 certificate
    can cause a NULL pointer dereference, resulting in a denial of service. An attacker
    can initiate or accept TLS connections using crafted certificates to trigger this
    vulnerability.

    Christian Heimes added the following comment.

    The bug is less critical and harder to exploit than I initially thought.
    td;dr if you have cert validation enabled and only trust public root CAs
    from CA/B forum, then you are not affected.

    The bug is only exploitable under two conditions:

    1) The user has disabled TLS/SSL certificate validation *and* calls
       getpeercert() in 3rd party code.

    2) Or the user trusts a CA that does not properly validate end-entity certificates.

    When cert validation is enabled, the ssl module will refuse any untrusted
    certificate during the handshake. The SSLSocket.getpeercert() and
    SSLObject.getpeercert() methods raise an exception, when the handshake was
    not successful. Python 2.7 - 3.6 hostname verification code only calls
    getpeercert() after the cert chain was validated successfully. Python 3.7+
    no longer calls getpeercert() for hostname verification. Further more
    hostname verification can't be enabled when cert validation is disabled.

    For publicly trusted CAs governed by CA/B baseline requirements, CRL DPs
    must by valid URI general names with HTTP links. From CA/Browser Forum
    Baseline Requirements Version 1.6.2, December 10, 2018, section 7.1.2.3.
    Subscriber Certificate:

    b. cRLDistributionPoints

    This extension MAY be present. If present, it MUST NOT be marked critical,
    and it MUST contain the HTTP URL of the CA’s CRL service.
